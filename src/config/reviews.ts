Very proactive in identifying issues that we would not even have recognized. Completed job ahead of schedule and in line with company identity. Lots of good ideas and suggestions that made a far better product. Great communication." ,

    reviewMessage: "I originally hired Jacob because I thought I needed someone who could help do the UI portion of my game. He did do that, however, our relationship really ended up being a much deeper engagement where Jacob would help me reorganize and rearchitect my codebase. Jacob can understand complex algorithms, as well as generate them. He was also invaluable at joining in group meetings and offering advice in terms of what he thought might be meaningful for the game. There were many times where Jacob was the person who created a prototype, and then the designer or UX person styled it up, rather than him having to wait on them for ideas. He not only follows direction but can help generate direction. He has a great eye for consistency and can generate new features with a feel similar to existing features. Overall I'd give Jacob a 10/10, I'd hire him again, and I'd suggest you hire him if given the opportunity to work with him!",

His speed and attention to detail were great and he helped us get this project successfully over the finish line. Currently we are engaged with him on other projects. We would recommend him highly for any engineering needs with the Unity engine.",
